# Rustee's Glamorous Textures

Hello there! IAmRustee and I bring you one of the most glamorous texture packs you will ever lay your eyes upon! This texture pack's goal is to **improve** and **glamorify** the plain vanilla textures while staying purely vanilla without relying on mods or mod loaders. This resource pack features the following:

- **Glamorified Tools and Weapons (includes a unique look for netherite tier!)**
- **Plated-looking Armors! (item)**
- **Improved Potions with tags to indicate the type.**
- **Beautiful and Immersive UIs!**
- **Improved Potion Effect Icons.**
- **Certain items such as the Totem of Undying, Compass, etc.**
- **Easily distinguishable Enchanted Books (some of them are animated!)**
- **Improved look and distinguishability for Fireworks and Firework Stars!**
- **Fancified Hotbar UI Elements!**
- **Unique look for Potions, Firework Rockets, and Ominous Bottles normally unobtainable without commands or the creative inventory.**

This texture pack is **compatible with version 1.21.5 and above** as well as **any specific mod loader (e.g. OptiFine, Fabric, Forge, etc. It doesn't require any, really.)** so download it, plop it into your resource pack folder and enjoy the game with a lot more flare than before!
