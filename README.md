# Rustee's Glamorous Textures

Hello there! IAmRustee and I bring you one of the most glamorous texture packs you will ever lay your eyes upon! This texture pack's goal is to **improve** and **glamorify** the plain vanilla textures for the following while staying purely vanilla without relying on mods or mod loaders:

- **Tools and Weapons**
- **Armors (item)**
- **Potions**
- **UIs**
- **Icons**
- **Certain items**

This texture pack is **compatible with version 1.21.5 and above** as well as any **specific mod loader (e.g. OptiFine, Fabric, Forge, etc. It doesn't require any, really.)** so download it, plop it into your resource pack folder and enjoy the game with a lot more flare than before!
