# Rustee's Glamorous Textures

Hello there! IAmRustee and I bring you one of the most glamorous texture packs you will ever lay your eyes upon! This texture pack's goal is to **improve** and **glamorify** the plain vanilla textures for the following while staying purely vanilla without relying on mods or mod loaders:
- **Tools and Weapons**
- **Armors (item)**
- **Potions**
- **UIs**
- **Icons**
- **Certain items**

This texture pack is **compatible with version 1.21.5** and any specific software *(e.g. OptiFine, Fabric, Forge, etc. It doesn't require any, really.)* so download it, plop it into your resource pack folder and enjoy the game with a lot more flare than before!

Thank you so much for checking my stuff out! If you need to ask me about my work, don't hesitate to dm me at discord: iamrustee.
